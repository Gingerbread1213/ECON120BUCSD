**The error u arises because of factors that influence Y but are not included in the regression function; so, there are always omitted variables.**
**Sometimes, the omission of those variables can lead to bias in the OLS estimator.**


**The bias in the OLS estimator that occurs as a result of an omitted factor is called omitted variable bias. For omitted variable bias to occur, the omitted factor “Z” must be:**

**1. A determinant of Y (i.e. Z is part of u); and**
We need consider that Z is one of the X, in OLS.

**2. Correlated with the regressor X (i.e. $corr(Z,X) \ne 0$)**
Also, Z have to have be dependent with the main regressor X.
